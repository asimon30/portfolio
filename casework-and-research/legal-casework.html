    <h1>Legal Casework and Research</h1>
    <h2>Legal Casework</h2>
  
<p>As a legal caseworker at Mobile Info Team, I manage a legal information hotline 
  that processes up to 50 inquiries per day, ranging from procedural 
  questions about asylum in Greece to complex legal documentation issues and 
  firsthand reports of human rights violations, including police violence in detention 
  centers and illegal border pushbacks.</p>
<p>The hotline is structured around a real-time, spreadsheet-based translation 
  and case coordination system, optimized for efficiency, collaborative use, and data security. 
  Incoming messages in Arabic are entered into a shared document with role-specific access 
  privileges. These are translated into English in a column-based schema: 
  original message → translation → drafted response → re-translation into Arabic → final message. 
  Each row represents a discrete inquiry object, with adjacent cells storing time stamps, case urgency flags, 
  and cross-references to partner organizations.</p>
<p>This system supports simultaneous collaboration between 2 translators and up to 3 legal caseworkers.
  Personal information is never stored within the main case spreadsheet. Instead, 
  a unique anonymized case ID links to a secure offline database containing sensitive 
  client data.</p>

<p>Our case triage model is computational in structure, guided by conditional logic that 
  assigns each inquiry a pathway—such as information provision, asylum interview 
  preparation, or psychosocial referral—based on urgency, and eligibility.
  This design supports task allocation among caseworkers.</p>

<p>In cases involving reports of human rights violations—such as unliveable camp conditions, illegal pushbacks, or 
  violence in camps—I collaborate with Advocacy and Research officers and the Border Violence 
  Monitoring Network (BVMN) to refer the testimony for collection. These testimonies are included in 
  reports published by Mobile Info Team or directed to the Greek and international press. </p>

<p>Testimonies from detention centers are also logged into the Detention Landscapes database, 
  a joint initiative between Mobile Info Team, BVMN, and Oxford University Border Criminologies Research. 
  Each report is coded using a standardized incident taxonomy and spatially indexed by camp 
  and detention site to support pattern recognition and visual analytics over time. </p>

  <p>This casework infrastructure is not only a logistical solution—it is a protective system, 
    designed in direct response to the asymmetries of power experienced by displaced individuals 
    navigating surveillance, detention, and state violence. Each element—from anonymized data 
    structures to the conditional triage model—is shaped by the practical need to deliver legal 
    advice to people who are affected by European immigration law, but have no access to it. 
    Working under these conditions has shaped my understanding of design as an adaptive, 
    computational practice: one that has to account for risk and urgency. These systems 
    are necessarily temporary and responsive; they are built to function within hostile and unstable 
    contexts. They also point to a broader question that is central to my practice: how can design 
    redistribute agency under constraint, and how can systems be constructed not to 
    extract or control, and to protect rather than exploit?</p>
