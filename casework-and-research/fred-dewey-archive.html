  <p>In the summer of 2023, I participated in an archival fellowship 
    through the Fred Dewey Legacy Project, archiving and documenting 
    the personal library of Fred Dewey. Dewey was a writer, artist, publisher, and civic activist. He co-founded the Neighborhood Councils movement in Los Angeles and served as director of the 
    Beyond Baroque Literary Arts Center from 1996 to 2010. </p>

   <p> In the 1990s, Dewey initiated the Hannah Arendt Working Group, 
    a series of public reading sessions devoted to the works of Hannah Arendt. 
    These sessions took place in various settings—including public spaces, squats, 
    universities, and private homes in Berlin, Paris, London, Amsterdam, Los Angeles, and Oslo. </p>

<p>The Working Group operated under a strict code of non-publicity: all participants were welcome, 
  but no recordings or documentation were permitted. Dewey facilitated the discussions to promote an 
  egalitarian approach to reading Arendt, intentionally disrupting academic hierarchies to create space 
  for open and inclusive dialogue among individuals from varied backgrounds and levels of education. </p>
  
 <p> Dewey understood Arendt’s writings as a foundation for political thought and discourse. 
  The Working Group sought to establish what Arendt called a “space of appearance”—a political 
  realm outside institutional structures and commodified public space, where genuine political 
  engagement could occur. </p>

<p>Following Dewey’s passing in 2021, his home library remained undisturbed. During the fellowship, 
  I lived in his residence for one month, exploring experimental archival methodologies to reflect 
  the breadth of his intellectual life. His annotations, postcards, inscriptions, and even fortune 
  cookie prophecies provided valuable insights into his modes of study and thought.</p>
  
  <p>In both Berlin and Los Angeles, I participated in Working Groups modeled on Dewey’s 
    original format. Artists, dancers, architects, and longtime collaborators convened to revisit 
    Arendt’s On Revolution, collaboratively attempting to revive the “space of appearance” as a site 
    of shared inquiry and political imagination.</p>
