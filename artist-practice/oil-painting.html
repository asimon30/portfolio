<p>Dew Mouth is a series of oil paintings, partially exhibited at Bard College Berlin's 
  Open Studios in the spring of 2022. The project emerged from visual research into the 
  phenomenon of "Dew Mouth"—a specific form of tooth decay endemic to the Appalachian 
  region of the southeastern United States. In mountainous areas with limited access to 
  water infrastructure, residents often rely on Mountain Dew, a type of soda, in place of 
  clean drinking water. </p>

<p>What began as a study of localized decay evolved into a broader exploration 
  of symbolic deterioration within the United States. The paintings depict 
  teeth visibly marked by this decay, distorted and combined with other symbols of 
  the mythic American narrative: engines, industrial machinery, horses, and 
  the aesthetics of power. These teeth serve as microcosmic evidence of larger 
  sociopolitical breakdowns. They are corporeal manifestations of a broader 
  collapse—reflecting the erosion of American political exceptionalism through the body.</p>
