    <p>In November 2022, I collaborated with four fellow student 
      artists to create a site-specific installation for the Pokoje 
      Exhibition of Young Art in Prague. Our project explored the spatial 
      and symbolic dimensions of borders—both political and ecological.</p>

      <p>We approached the room as a space to challenge the linearity of 
        boundary-making, experimenting with vertical and horizontal planes 
        to evoke dividing-lines as fragile and shifting.

      </p>


<p>The installation featured a multi-layered video projection: a static 
  horizon line dispersed across suspended translucent sheets, visually “shattering” 
  as it encountered interruptions in the fabric, disrupting the horizon as a 
  universal visual anchor. </p>
