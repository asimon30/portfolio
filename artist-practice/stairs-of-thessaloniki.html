<p>Stairs of Thessaloniki is an ongoing archival and visual research project 
  that documents gravestone fragments from the old Jewish cemetery of Thessaloniki, 
  demolished in the mid-20th century after World War II. These gravestones—once part of 
  one of the largest Sephardic cemeteries in Europe—were repurposed as building material 
  across the city, most visibly as steps in the old town. There is no public registry of the
  fragments. Traces remain: Hebrew inscriptions embedded in stairways, cornerstones of churches, 
  and municipal structures. </p>

  <p></p>The project considers Thessaloniki as a palimpsest of cultural erasure and revision. 
  Once a thriving center of Jewish intellectual and mercantile life in the 19th century, the 
  city was known as a cosmopolitan center where Ladino, Greek, Turkish, and 
  French were spoken in the streets. Following dramatic political shifts to the formation of 
  the modern Greek state building project—this pluralism was gradually 
  replaced by cultural and religious homogeneity. The cemetery’s destruction, 
  and the reuse of its stones, mark a material layer of this nation-building process,
  along with the deportation of the city’s Jewish population to Nazi concentration camps in occupied Poland.</p>
  
  <p>By locating and mapping these scattered fragments, the project attempts to 
  reconstruct a lost topography. It attempts to account for an architectures of loss. In doing 
  so, it also shows modern Thessaloniki as a stage in a multi-layered history- and uncovers the many 
  iterations in the city's past. </p>
