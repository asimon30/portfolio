  <p>Open Source Aesthetics is an ongoing visual research project developed collaboratively 
    by artists, curators, humanitarian aid workers, and human rights monitoring researchers. 
    Drawing on methods of open source investigation, the project examines 
    the aesthetic residue of human rights monitoring—foregrounding the visual 
    byproducts of documentation and verification efforts.</p>
  <p>By presenting materials used in human rights investigations through 
    an artistic lens, the project interrogates the role of aesthetic imagery in both 
    advocacy and research. It invites reflection on how such imagery functions—not only 
    as evidence, but also as a constructed and mediated form— prompting critical 
    inquiry into its context, and questioning what is lost when these images are presented alienated from their context. </p> 
   <p>The project aims to provoke dialogue at the intersection of image and source, 
    aesthetics and politics—complicating notions of truth, visibility, and representation 
    in contemporary human rights methods.</p>
